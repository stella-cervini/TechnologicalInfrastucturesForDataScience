# Technological Infrastructure for Data Science

## Introduction

This repository includes a comprehensive exploration of data pipelines and their essential role in managing and processing big data.

## Project Overview

This project dives deep into various aspects of data pipelines, including:

- **Big Data and Value Chain**: Understanding the components and importance of big data.
- **Data Pipelines**: Detailed exploration of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), ELT (Extract, Load, Transform), and their comparison.
- **Traditional and Modern Data Pipelines**: Phases, orchestration, and opportunities in managing data pipelines.
- **Challenges and Architectures**: Medallion architecture, challenges in data pipeline management, and types of data pipeline architectures like batch, streaming, and Lambda.

## Key Topics

1. **Introduction to Big Data**: Characteristics of big data, including volume, variety, velocity, value, and veracity.
2. **Value Chain**: How data technology can be optimized using value chains.
3. **Data Pipelines**:
   - Definition and components (data sources, processing, storage, sinks).
   - Core tasks (ingestion, processing, storage, consumption).
   - Supporting tasks (monitoring, management).
   - Types and design patterns (ETL, ELT, streaming ETL, CDC).
   - Use cases and architectures (batch, streaming, Lambda).

This repository serves as a resource for anyone looking to understand the technological infrastructure necessary for effective data science practices. It includes theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and insights into managing the complexity of modern data pipelines.
